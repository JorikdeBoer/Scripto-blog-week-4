# Scripto blog week 4
A blog application to share your writings with the world!

A new version of the previous Scripto blog application with new features based in the CodeGorilla assignment of week 4.
New additions that will be hopefully implemented in this version include: 
autocomplete of user-defined shortcuts, 
multiple categories per blog, 
comment section per blog post,
deletion of comments, 
blocked comment for certain blog posts, 
etc.
